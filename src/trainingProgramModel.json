Deliberately entering a spin or the benign spiral mode while still at low airspeed can allow for a safe exit from inadvertent cloud entry, but the glider might hit a ridge or mountain before exiting cloud.  For these reasons - and to remain within the law regarding cloud flying - pilots need to learn a healthy respect for clouds, and keep a vigilant lookout for the traps which can lead to inadvertent entry.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In particular drifting back into (or above) cloud in ridge or wave conditions happens very easily because these clouds are geo-stationary while the wind is not. The wind flows through these clouds and could take the inattentive pilot with it.  Instantaneous cloud formation below or around the glider can also occur with a slight change in humidity or wind direction - leading to a sudden lowering or filling in of the cloud base.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\">\n   <i>\n    Note:\n   </i>\n   a full explanation of the benign spiral mode is given in \"To Cross Country Pilot\".  This is the safest action to take in the event of inadvertent entry into cloud.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Pass:\n  </i>\n  When flying near (ridge or wave) clouds the pilot stays well clear of cloud, including newly-forming cloud upwind of the glider, and shows a keen awareness of the hazard of drifting downwind into the geostationary cloud.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n</div>\n",
